ls - list files
ls -t -> list files in time order
ls -l -> long 

ls will list also a 'total number', where the number is number of blocks the files occupy on disk. Usually a block is 512 or 1024 characters.

explanation of long format:
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 user group 24984 Feb 11 12:17 tty
first part is if its dir: - or d
file permission part: rwxr-xr-x
user permissions: rwx
group permissions: r-x
other persmissions: r-x
last part: . - don't know what it means:)
number of links: 1
name of user: user
name of group: group
size in bytes: 24984
date changed/created: Feb 11 12:17
filename: tty

ls -lt -> you can group options together
ls -lut -> long, sorted by date, -u date when files where used
ls -r -> reverse...for example ls -lrt in reverse sorted by date

print files - cat or pr

move/rename files = mv 
copy files = cp
remove files = rm

...experienced users find talkative commands annoying.

filenames:
- there is a limit to length
- don't use special at beginning like '-' etc
- '.' used also to divide files into chunks
- file sensitive junk, Junk, JUNK are 3 different files

wc - word count, prints number of lines, words and characters in one or more files

grep - search in files for lines that match a pattern

grep pattern file - search for lines which contain given pattern in file
grep -v pattern file - search for lines which do not contain given pattern in file

sort - sort input into alphanumerical order line by line
sort -r -> reverse
sort -n -> sort in numerical order
sort -nr -> sort in reverse numerical order
sort -f -> fold upper and lower case together
sort +n -> sort starting at n+1-st field

tail -> print tail of file, e.g. last 10 lines of file
tail -<number> -> print <number> of last lines in file
this doesn't work anymore: tail +<number> -> print file starting at line <number> in file

cmp - compare 2 files and find first difference in them
